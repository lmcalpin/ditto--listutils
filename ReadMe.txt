An addin for the Ditto! Clipboard Manager from http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net/

Adds utility methods to paste in altered versions of clips.  It will take CRLF delimited content and convert them into a comma delimited string and vice versa, quote each line of a clip, trim whitepace from each line in a clip, etc.
